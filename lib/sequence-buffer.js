/*
Compares two 16 bit sequence numbers and returns true if the first one is greater than the second (considering wrapping).

http://gafferongames.com/networking-for-game-programmers/reliability-and-flow-control

Sequence numbers are 16 bit integers. These numbers wrap around in only 30 minutes.

The trick is to realize that if the current sequence number is already very
high, and the next sequence number that comes in is very low, then you must
have wrapped around. So even though the new sequence number is numerically
lower than the current sequence value, it actually represents a more recent
packet.

For example, lets say we encoded sequence numbers in one byte (bad idea btw :))
then they would wrap around after 255 like this:

    ... 252, 253, 254, 255, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...

To handle this case we need a new function that is aware of the fact that
sequence numbers wrap around to zero after 255, so that 0, 1, 2, 3 are
considered more recent than 255. Otherwise, our reliability system stops
working after you receive packet 255.

This function works by comparing the two numbers and their difference. If their
difference is less than 1/2 the maximum sequence number value, then they must be
close together – so we just check if one is greater than the other, as usual.
However, if they are far apart, their difference will be greater than 1/2 the
max sequence, then we paradoxically consider the sequence number more recent if
it is less than the current sequence number.

This last bit is what handles the wrap around of sequence numbers
transparently, so 0,1,2 are considered more recent than 255.
